## What is NetUSB?
**Westpay NetUSB** is the name for our implementation of Remote NDIS (RNDIS) in our payment terminals.

RNDIS is a method of providing IP connectivity over USB. We use this feature in combination with Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) to supply the terminal with external network connection over USB. 

### What will i find in this repo?
This repo contains information, instructions and helpful scripts that can be used to automate or simplify the activation of ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) between the Host (PC) and our Device (Westpay payment terminal)
